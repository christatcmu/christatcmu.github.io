          <p>The Carnegie Mellon University Catholic Newman Club is a social, religious, and service organization for students who are practicing Catholics, and also those who are otherwise interested in Catholicism.

We work with the Ryan Catholic Newman Center (run by the Pittsburgh Oratory), campus missionaries through the Fellowship of Catholic University Students (FOCUS), and the University of Pittsburgh's Newman Club to host and promote both on campus and cross-campus social, religious, and service events. Our main goal is to promote understanding, education, and the practice of the Catholic faith on Carnegie Mellon's campus and to help every student authentically flourish.</p>

It is vital to have Christian companions, throughout our college years, to build, preserve, and strengthen our faith. We need to gather together more than ever before to enjoy God, receive His mercy and find grace for timely help (Heb. 4:16)!</p>

          <p>In serving the Pittsburgh university community (Pitt, CMU, Chatham, Carlow, Duquesne, CCAC, Point Park, RMU, La Roche, et al), we come together by the Spirit as one Body, wonderfully united as the liturgy of the Divine Service connects us to Christ, to each other, and to the Church of the ages. Today’s student has a place here!

            Our full-time pastoral staff, active student leadership, and central location provide excellent opportunity to gather together regularly as a true community of believers, serving each other and our neighbors through the Sunday Divine Service, mid-week evening prayer, the diligent study of God’s Word and the Confessions, local and international mission and service projects, congregational leadership, dinners, social activities, regional retreats, volunteerism, and much, much more!
            
            This is a place for creating, nurturing, and proclaiming faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. It is truly a home where you can live and belong and grow! This is a place for YOU!
