We are open to all from those who are just interested and curious about Christ to those who have been believers their whole life. We believe in sharing the gospel and the love of Christ through investing and engaging in other&rsquo;s lives.</p>

          <p>Christians on Campus (CoC) is a student group comprising pursuers of genuine Christian belief from various backgrounds. We love the Lord Jesus and endeavor to give Him the first place in all things (Col. 1:18). It is vital to have Christian companions, throughout our college years, to build, preserve, and strengthen our faith. We need to gather together more than ever before to enjoy God, receive His mercy and find grace for timely help (Heb. 4:16)!</p>

          <p>In serving the Pittsburgh university community (Pitt, CMU, Chatham, Carlow, Duquesne, CCAC, Point Park, RMU, La Roche, et al), we come together by the Spirit as one Body, wonderfully united as the liturgy of the Divine Service connects us to Christ, to each other, and to the Church of the ages. Today’s student has a place here!

            Our full-time pastoral staff, active student leadership, and central location provide excellent opportunity to gather together regularly as a true community of believers, serving each other and our neighbors through the Sunday Divine Service, mid-week evening prayer, the diligent study of God’s Word and the Confessions, local and international mission and service projects, congregational leadership, dinners, social activities, regional retreats, volunteerism, and much, much more!
            
            This is a place for creating, nurturing, and proclaiming faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. It is truly a home where you can live and belong and grow! This is a place for YOU!
