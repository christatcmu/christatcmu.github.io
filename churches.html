          <p class="church-desc">The Shadyside Presbyterian Church (PC(USA)) is a traditional and winsome community of faith. We take very seriously the theological depth, beauty, and gravitas of Christianity&rsquo;s tradition. This is especially true in our worship services. Worship at Shadyside offers spiritual refreshment in a traditional liturgical setting. We believe that this great tradition should make us loving, relational, and very devoted to the mission of Jesus Christ in the community and world around us. The church is centered in the grace of Jesus Christ, and we talk about that a lot. Since we are all clear about that common center, we spend little time here worrying about the boundary issues that exclude people. Our church holds together just fine by its center. Join us Sundays for our area college students&rsquo; Bible study, Donut Society, at 9:30am and/or worship at 11am.</p>

          <p class="church-desc">We are a place of welcome, peace, and joy to all who desire to join us. Our parish family is richly diverse, with people of different ages and ethnic backgrounds. It is a special blessing and joy, indeed, to see the thousands and thousands of college students and young adults who come to the Cathedral to worship and grow in their faith.</p>
