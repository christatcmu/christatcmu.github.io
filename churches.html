We also host catechetical and formational programs. In addition to these we organize student retreats, service projects, and social events of all kinds. With all of these activities, we seek to meet the personal and spiritual needs of those who live and labor on the local campuses.</p>

          <p class="church-desc">The Shadyside Presbyterian Church is a traditional and winsome community of faith. We take very seriously the theological depth, beauty, and gravitas of Christianity&rsquo;s tradition. This is especially true in our worship services. Worship at Shadyside offers spiritual refreshment in a traditional liturgical setting. We believe that this great tradition should make us loving, relational, and very devoted to the mission of Jesus Christ in the community and world around us. The church is centered in the grace of Jesus Christ, and we talk about that a lot. Since we are all clear about that common center, we spend little time here worrying about the boundary issues that exclude people. Our church holds together just fine by its center. Join us Sundays for our area college students&rsquo; Bible study, Donut Society, at 9:30am and/or worship at 11am.</p>
