    <p>Pittsburgh colleges and universities offer a wealth of courses covering Christian history, theology, culture, the Bible, and the relationships between Christianity and other religions. But students often have trouble identifying these courses or feel they cannot fit them into their degree programs. That's why faculty at area institutions are collaborating to bring together a listing of Christian Studies courses across the disciplines in one place, updated each semester. We help students find pathways to fit their interests, their major course of study, and their career goals, using all of Pittsburgh's combined resources.</p>

    <p>Vision School is an eight-week missions training program that discovers and examines God&rsquo;s character and His longing heart for all people and all nations. Weekly lectures impart the Father&rsquo;s love for unreached people groups and open students&rsquo; eyes to what God is and has been doing all over the world to advance His Kingdom. Our goal is to train young adults to become history-makers by challenging paradigms about missions and Christian living. Each Vision School session consists of praise and worship, lectures from various speakers, testimonies from missionaries who have served in the 10/40 missions window, and nation-selling.</p>
